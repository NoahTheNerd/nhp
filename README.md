*A modular packet system for Housing!*

But what does "a modular packet system" mean, you might ask? NHP offers you many useful utilities that can let you bring your Housing experience to a greater level than ever before.

You can do things normal Housing cant even fathom, like manipulating the bossbar! Many features are in the works, so make sure to check the [roadmap](#roadmap)

| Bossbars        | ✅ | ❌ 
| Auto Visibility | ⏳ | ❌

## ☀️ Latest Stable Ver.
Run this command in the chatbox of your Minecraft client with [ChatTriggers](https://chattriggers.com/) installed.

    /ct import nhp 

## 🌒 Nightly Ver.
> [!NOTE]
> At the current time, Nightly does **not** include auto updating.

Grab a copy of the `.zip` source code by pressing the green <kbd><> Code</kbd> button in the top right.

You can then download a zip. Head into Minecraft with ChatTriggers and run the `/ct files` command in chat. It should bring you to the ChatTriggers folder. If instead you see a few existing folders, click the one labelled modules. 

Paste your `.zip` file and unzip it. It should make a folder called nhp-master that has another folder called nhp-master. Drag this subfolder into the modules folder and overwrite the existing nhp-master folder. Now, rename it to `nhp` with no capitalization.

Once this is done, run `/ct load` in Minecraft, and NHP is now installed!
